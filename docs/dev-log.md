## Phase 0 - Foundation

### Open architectural questions for Phase 1

1. **Compute path: Router vs Direct.** Roadmap Section 3.3 specifies the Direct
   SDK (`@0glabs/0g-serving-broker`) with manual ledger funding and TeeML
   verification. Since the roadmap was written, 0G has shipped the Compute
   Router - an OpenAI-compatible HTTPS gateway with API-key auth.
   **Update from Phase 0 dashboard inspection:** the Router supports a
   `verify_tee: true` request flag that returns on-chain TEE attestation in the
   response trace (`tee_verified` field). Confirmed working with
   `qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct` on testnet. This means Router does not sacrifice
   the per-call attestation surface - it exposes it as opt-in. Phase 1 should
   standardize on Router for `sealed0GInference` unless the Direct SDK exposes
   attestation properties Router does not, such as raw TEE quote bytes for our
   own verification, or per-provider key pinning. Recommendation logged for
   Phase 1 kickoff: default Router, evaluate Direct only if a concrete
   sovereignty requirement demands it.
2. **Built-in SDK encryption.** `@0gfoundation/0g-ts-sdk@1.2.6+` ships native
   AES-256 + ECIES encryption. We're pinned to 1.2.1 which predates this.
   Roadmap Section 6.2 specifies our own `encrypted()` wrapper. Phase 1 must
   decide: (a) stay on 1.2.1 and write our own per spec - gives full control over
   key derivation from wallet sig per Section 6.3, or (b) upgrade >=1.2.6 and
   wrap the SDK's encryption. Either is defensible.
3. **Package naming.** Roadmap calls the storage SDK `@0glabs/0g-ts-sdk`; the
   actually-published package is `@0gfoundation/0g-ts-sdk`. Phase 0 uses the
   correct one. Future references in code/docs should match.

### Phase 0 → Phase 1 handoff: TEE field path resolved

Step 1.0 of Phase 1 ran `scripts/inspect-router-response.ts` against the
testnet Router with `qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct`. Result:

- **TEE attestation field:** `x_0g_trace.tee_verified` (boolean).
- **Provider address:** `x_0g_trace.provider` (0x-prefixed, on-chain).
- **Request ID:** `x_0g_trace.request_id` (UUID, useful for support tickets).
- **Per-call billing:** `x_0g_trace.billing.{input_cost, output_cost, total_cost}`
  (string-encoded wei).

The Router uses an `x_0g_trace` envelope for all 0G-specific metadata.
This is the canonical extension point and Phase 1's `sealed0GInference`
adapter will type it explicitly.

**Confirmed live:** `tee_verified: true` returned for this model + provider
combination. TEE attestation is a real, verified claim, not theatre.

**Phase 1 implication:** `InferenceResult` will surface a typed `attestation:
{ teeVerified: boolean; providerAddress: string }` block and a `billing:
{ inputCost: bigint; outputCost: bigint; totalCost: bigint }` block on
every result. The roadmap §7.4 update from Phase 0 stands; we now have
the field path it referenced.

### Phase 1 Step 1.3 Turn B - Agent class + Phase 1 DoD

- Typed event emitter (`run.start`, `run.complete`, `run.error`, `tool.call`,
  `tool.result`).
- Agent class composing inference + memory + history + tools + lifecycle hooks.
- Run loop: build messages -> beforeRun -> inference -> afterRun -> persist
  context -> append history -> emit `run.complete`. Lifecycle hooks per Section
  7.5 (`onTransfer`/`onRevoke` bodies are Phase 3 territory but the hook surface
  is reserved).
- `examples/agent-hello`: end-to-end Phase 1 DoD example; runs against real 0G
  Galileo testnet, writes encrypted context to 0G Log, prints attestation.

**Phase 1 deferred:**

- Tool-calling loop (model-driven function calling): Phase 2.
- `onTransfer` hook body: Phase 3 (needs iNFT lifecycle).
- `onRevoke` hook: Phase 3.
- `maxConcurrentRuns` enforcement: Phase 5 (mesh introduces real concurrency).
- Reflection module: Phase 6 (its own package).

**Phase 1 status: DONE.** Tag: `phase-1-complete`.

### Phase 1 Step 1.3 Turn A — core foundation

- Typed errors: CoreError, InferenceError + 6 subtypes (Router{Auth,Balance,Client,Server}Error,
  InferenceTimeoutError, EmptyInferenceResponseError, DirectModeUnsupportedError),
  ToolError + 3 subtypes (Tool{Validation,Execution,Timeout}Error).
- sealed0GInference adapter: Router-based, surfaces typed Attestation
  (teeVerified, providerAddress, requestId from x_0g_trace) and BillingInfo
  (input/output/total cost as bigint wei from x_0g_trace.billing).
- Tool runtime: defineTool helper, executeTool with validation + timeout,
  httpRequestTool built-in with optional allowedHosts whitelist.

**Deferred from §7.3 (logged for later):**

- onChainTx tool — not needed until Phase 3+ when iNFT lifecycle is exposed.
- fileGen tool — needed for Phase 9 IncomeClaw pitch deck flow, not Phase 1.

Both can be added in any future phase without breaking the public API.


### Phase 1 Step 1.3 Turn B — Agent class + Phase 1 DoD

- Typed event emitter (run.start, run.complete, run.error, tool.call, tool.result).
- Agent class composing inference + memory + history + tools + lifecycle hooks.
- Run loop: build messages → beforeRun → inference → afterRun → persist context →
  append history → emit run.complete. Lifecycle hooks per §7.5 (onTransfer/onRevoke
  bodies are Phase 3 territory but the hook surface is reserved).
- examples/agent-hello: end-to-end Phase 1 DoD example; runs against real 0G
  Galileo testnet, writes encrypted context to 0G Log, prints attestation.

**Phase 1 deferred (each defensible per §19.15 / §7.5 hook reservations):**
- Tool-calling loop (model-driven function calling): Phase 2.
- onTransfer hook body: Phase 3 (needs iNFT lifecycle).
- onRevoke hook: Phase 3.
- maxConcurrentRuns enforcement: Phase 5 (mesh introduces real concurrency).
- Reflection module: Phase 6 (its own package).

**Phase 1 status: DONE.** Tag: `phase-1-complete`.


### Phase 1 — DONE (May 2 2026)

Phase 1 finish-line example ran cleanly against 0G Galileo testnet:
- wallet: 0x236E59315dD2Fc05704915a6a1a7ba4791cc3b5B
- example tx hash: 0x8d01de05b56c9d14b27908dc9ad2401e98ee99d1fca3e5163c6e29192362fe8b
- ciphertext root: 0x15374fb658b3765de35ba8d09f4f68d2df38bd8d41988e4dba6c4bae67a917a6
- model: qwen2.5-7b-instruct via 0G Compute Router
- provider: 0xa48f01287233509FD694a22Bf840225062E67836
- TEE verified: true
- inference latency: 2.5s
- per-call cost: 2.25e-6 0G

Test counts at Phase 1 close: 108 unit (core 60 + memory 48), 3 integration,
1 end-to-end example. Build, lint, typecheck all green.

Phase 1 deferred (each defensible per §19.15, picked up in named later phases):
- Tool-calling loop → Phase 2
- onTransfer hook body, onRevoke → Phase 3
- maxConcurrentRuns enforcement → Phase 5
- Reflection module → Phase 6
- onChainTx and fileGen tools → Phase 9 (IncomeClaw)
